# 【AI Health Summit 2023】HealthCarer: LLM-based Daily Health Assistant 

# Abstract
We propose HealthCarer, a framework for personal health assistants powered by large language models (LLMs)， as Figure 1 shows. We validate LLMs' ability to extract physiological vitals from FDA-approved devices and analyze abnormal medical data, demonstrating their strong performance in calculating vital indicators. The best Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for vital signs computation exhibits values below 1 beat per minute (bpm) for heart rate and below 1% for oxygen saturation (SpO2). Additionally, the best Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for these calculations remains below 1% and the accuracy of health assessment could reach above 85%. For image analysis, our GPTs model achieves below 1 bpm MAE for cycle count dealing with photoplethysmography (PPG).  LLMs serve as personalized health companions, understanding user contexts and needs, fostering the next generation of AI health assistants at the interface of wearables and medical LLMs.
